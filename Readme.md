This Repository contains implementation of **K_Means Algorithm** from scratch in numpy.

**Dataset Used** : 50,000 Images from CIFAR Dataset
  1. Load the data from the following link:
     https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
     
**Features(Generated for each CIFAR Images):** \
  1. Every ML technique requires a carefully crafted features on which that particular algorithm is trained, Similarly our K_Means Algorithm will require some appropriate feature vector.\
  2. Feature Generation(For KMeans):\
       a) Convert images to grayscale images.\
       b) Find the histograms and get a 10-dimensional representation of each images\
       c) For each image, find the histogram with bin size 25 (last bin of 30;i.e.225-255;giving you 10 bins)\
       d) Data Matrix = Datapoints x Feature Size = 5000 x 10\
       
**Distance-Metric utilized here in K-Means Algorithm**: L2-Distance

**Visulization** : Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
